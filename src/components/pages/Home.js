            <p>
                Hello, my name is Charles Franklin Jahn, and I recently completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from CCT Dublin College in 2024. This web application is part of my ongoing efforts to deepen my knowledge and proficiency in React and related technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
                This website is built using React and is hosted on GitHub Pages, with Firebase serving as the backend for data management. The primary objective of this project is to provide hands-on experience in developing a full-fledged CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application, which is a fundamental aspect of modern web development.
            </p>
            <p>
                The web app allows users to add, view, and manage visitor information, including their name, age, country of origin, and the time of their visit. This functionality is powered by Firebase Firestore, which securely stores the data and ensures that the information is available for retrieval and modification as needed.

                I kindly request users to refrain from using offensive or inappropriate names when entering data. Additionally, as this is a project developed during my learning journey, I appreciate your understanding and patience if you encounter any bugs or issues. I am actively working on improving the application and your feedback is invaluable in this process.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thank you for visiting, and I hope this project reflects my commitment to becoming a proficient web developer!
